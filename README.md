# Hetzner Dynamic DNS Daemon

Continuously update your servers' _A_ and _AAAA_ records with dynamic IP addresses.

Manage Hetzner DNS records across several domains, with various records at different TTLs, on multiple network interfaces. This portable utility helps you get it done quickly and easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hetzner recently changed how their DNS service works. If you haven't migrated your existing DNS zones to the new _RRSets_ system under Hetzner Console, use the deprecated [`0.2.6`](https://github.com/filiparag/hetzner_ddns/releases/tag/0.2.6) version of this utility.

## Configuration

Configuration file is formatted using JSON. For manual installation, it is located at `/usr/local/etc/hetzner_ddns.json`, while for prebuilt packages it may be moved to `/etc/`, `/etc/config/` or `/usr/pkg/etc/`.

To quickly get up and running, the following minimal configuration can be used:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "api_key": "****************************************************************",
  "zones": [
    {
      "domain": "example.com",
      "records": [
        {
          "name": "@/homelab/media"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

It will update both `A` and `AAAA` records for domain root `example.com` and its subdomains `homelab` and `media`.

> [!NOTE]
> All records have to be added in the [Hetzner Console](https://console.hetzner.com/) first, and only have one record per every name and type combination. The utility will otherwise terminate to prevent unexpected modifications.
>
> An API key can be also obtained in the Console, under Security > API tokens > Generate API token, and selecting Read & Write option.

        <b>Advanced configuration</b>
    </summary>

If you need fine-grained control, the configuration can be expanded to have different TTL and egress interface per type of record. For example, you can have the `A` record of `test.example.com` subdomain use external IPv4 address of a `eth0` interface and be updated every minute, while the `AAAA` record uses `vpn1` interface which rarely changes its IPv6 address, so it can be updated hourly:

```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "records": [
    {
      "name": "test",
      "type": "A",
      "ttl": 60,
      "interface": "eth0"
    },
    {
      "name": "test",
      "type": "AAAA",
      "ttl": 3600,
      "interface": "vpn1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Values for `type`, `ttl` and `interface` can be ommited, in which case reasonable defaults will be used. You can override them by adding this object to the root of the configuration tree:

```jsonc
{
  "defaults": {
    "type": "A", // Default record type (can be "A", "AAAA", or "A/AAAA")
    "ttl": 1800, // Default TTL value in seconds (60 <= TTL <= 2147483647)
    "interface": "eth2" // Default network interface name (auto-detect if unspecified)
  }
}
```

Additionally, the utility rate limits checking for changes of external IP addresses on used network interfaces. This and some other preferences can be modified by changing fields of this object:

```jsonc
{
  "settings": {
    "log_file": "", // Path to a custom configuration file
    "ip_check_cooldown": 30, // Time between subsequent checks of interface's IP address
    "request_timeout": 10, // Maximum duration of HTTP requests
    "api_url": "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1", // URL of the Hetzner Console's API
    "ip_url": "https://ip.hetzner.com/" // URL of a service for retreiving external IP addresses
  }
}
```

An example of a configuration tree can be found [here](./hetzner_ddns.json).

## Usage

**Run on startup**

```shell
# systemd
sudo systemctl enable hetzner_ddns

# FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenWrt
sudo service hetzner_ddns enable

# OpenRC
sudo rc-update add hetzner_ddns
```

**Start/Stop**

```shell
# systemd
sudo systemctl start/stop hetzner_ddns

# FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenRC and OpenWrt
sudo service hetzner_ddns start/stop
```

**Reload (trigger update of all records)**

```shell

        <b>Manual usage and debugging</b>
    </summary>

The utility can also be run by any user on the system from the command line. For quick debugging, run it in verbose mode with a specified configuration file:

```shell
hetzner_ddns -V -c ./test_configuration.json
```

The following is the list of all optional arguments:

- `-c <file>` Use specified configuration file
- `-l <file>` Use specified log file
- `-V` Display all log messages to stderr
- `-d` Detach from current shell and run as a deamon
- `-h` Print help and exit
- `-v` Print version and exit
